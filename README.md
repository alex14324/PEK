#This module exploits a Remote Code Execution in the web panel of Phoenix Exploit Kit via the geoip.php. The
        Phoenix Exploit Kit is a popular commercial crimeware tool that probes the browser of the visitor for the
        presence of outdated and insecure versions of browser plugins like Java, and Adobe Flash and Reader which
        then silently installs malware.
